# How to access the MRI Together Zoom conference: tutorials and resources

Following two short tutorials on how to join this Zoom Event conference. As it is not a standard Zoom Webinar, the procedure to join the various sessions are different from normal zoom. The procedure must be initiated in the browser by visiting [https://events.zoom.us/](https://events.zoom.us/) and by logging in with your zoom account.

A Zoom client, logged into the same Zoom account as the website, is also required.

Unfortunately the "lobby" option is only available for Windows and Mac users; the same is true for starting a session as a speaker or moderator. Linux and portable users can still join the conference, but not chat with the other participants or start a session.

If you are a **speaker/panelist/moderator**, you **don't have to register** through the registration link, as your ticket was already included in the invitation that we sent you.

For any further questions, please write an email to [mritogether.workshop@gmail.com](mailto:mritogether.workshop@gmail.com)
