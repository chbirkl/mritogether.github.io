# Registration

For our MRI community, this workshop is a first of its kind. In order to promote inclusivity and encourage reproducibility within our field, we feel strongly that participation should be accessible to all. We are therefore offering you the option to register free of charge. However, in order to host this workshop, we have minimum costs we need to cover. If youâ€™d like to support this workshop and future similar endeavors, please consider registering as a supporting attendee or **[becoming an ESMRMB member](https://www.esmrmb.org/membership/#m-application)**.

We encourage senior, funded researchers and professors to register as supporting attendees, providing a donation such that students and fellow researchers with restricted fundings are able to enjoy the meeting free of charge. As a thank you for your contribution, we will keep a list of our supporting attendees on our website (which you can opt out from, if you wish to remain anonymous).

**Note:** the conference will be held through the [Zoom Events](https://events.zoom.us/) platform. A Zoom account (available free of charge) is required at registration.
